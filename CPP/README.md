# Recursive-Back-Tracker

The first version (oldVersion.cpp) I designed as a challenge for myself to create a random maze without using any classes back in 2017.

The second version (newVersion.cpp) I decided to rewrite the entire oldVersion.cpp because it was inefficient and I learned some new tricks since then.

The third version (pathfinder.cpp) was quickly made after newVersion.cpp because I wasn't satisfied with a simple rewrite.
