# Kruskal-Maze-Generator

Developed in 2019, I wanted to continue my advances in different maze generation algorithms after the recursive back tracker.
Personally this is my favorite algorithm so far for generating mazes as it is much more random than the recursive back tracker. There are long hallways intersperced with different openings compared to just a simple long hallway/t-bones with the recursive.
